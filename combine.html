        <h1>BUTTERFLY SIGHTINGS IN AUSTRALIA</h1> <h3>Year 2013-2023</h3>
        <h4>Recording butterfly sightings in Australia is crucial for monitoring biodiversity and assessing the health of ecosystems. Butterflies are sensitive indicators of environmental changes, such as climate shifts and habitat loss. Their presence or absence can signal broader ecological trends and help scientists make informed conservation decisions. Citizen scientists' contributions, such as the data displayed in this visualisation, enhance our understanding of local and regional species distributions, aiding in the protection of these delicate and beautiful insects and the ecosystems they inhabit. </h4>

              <h3><br>Geographic Distribution</h3>
              <p> The visualisation on the left showcases the geographic distribution of butterfly sightings across Australia from year 2013-2023. Analysis of the visualisation reveals that butterfly sightings are most common in costal regions of Australia.
                <br><br> This could be attributed to:
                <br><br>
                1.	 Coastal regions offering a more favourable temperature range for butterfly activity.
                <br><br>
                2.	 More abundant plants are often more abundant in coastal regions due to the milder climate and higher rainfall.
                <br><br>
                3.	 Coastal areas tend to have a greater variety of habitats, including forests, wetlands, and open spaces, which provide diverse environments and food sources for butterflies.
                <br><br>
                4.	 Costal areas are more populated than other regions of Australia, resulting in more recorded sightings from citizen scientists.

        <h3><br>Trends in sightings across <Br> 2013-2023</h3>
          <p>
            This dot-map maps the sightings across 2013-2023, revealing that:
            <br> <br>
            1.	 The number of sightings is steadily increasing across the years.
            <br> <br>
            2.	 This was revealed to be true for all family of butterflies when the Family filter is applied. 
            <br> <br>
            3.	The number of sightings in butterfly encounters has also increased over the years, with larger circles (indicating a greater number of sightings) observed more frequently in recent years. 
            <br> <br>
            4.	This was similarly revealed to be true for all family of butterflies when the Family filter is applied.

        <h3><br> Trends in sightings based on monthes of the year</h3>
          <p>Analysing the histogram on the right reveals that:
            <br> <br>
            1.	March documented the highest number of sightings.
            <br> <br>
            2.	August documented the lowest number of sightings.
            <br> <br>
            3.	Comparable sightings were recorded in October, November and December. 
            <br> <br>
            These observations are in line with scientific estimations based on the seasonal climate, life cycle patterns, migration, and floral availability, which are likely to cause variation in butterfly sightings in Australia throughout the year.

          <h3><br>Sightings data analysis</h3>
          <p>The donut chart on the left-hand side illustrates several key insights regarding butterfly sightings in Australia. Firstly, Queensland stands out as the region with the highest number of total butterfly sightings, indicating its prevalence as a habitat for these insects. Following Queensland, the order of most to least sightings goes as follows: New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, Australian Capital Territory, South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory with the fewest recorded sightings. Meanwhile, the accompanying bar chart on the right-hand side delves into the family distribution of these sightings. Nymphalidae emerges as the most frequently observed butterfly family, followed by Pieridae, Lycarnidae, and Papilionidae. Making Hesperiidae the least commonly sighted family of butterflies in the region.</p>
